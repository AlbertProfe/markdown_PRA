## Sprint 1: JS Basics + Spring Boot + SQL
### Goal:
- Build a foundational understanding of **JavaScript**, integrate it with **Spring Boot**, and interact with an **SQL database**.

### Code:
- Complete MOOC **JavaScript** basics modules.
- Create a Spring Boot backend that connects to an SQL database.
- Implement a basic **CRUD application**.

### Book:
- Begin reviewing *"System Design Interview"* (read Chapter 1).

### Major Deliverable:
- Functional **CRUD App** using JavaScript for frontend logic and Spring Boot for the backend with SQL.

### Milestones:
1. Complete JavaScript Fundamentals (loops, arrays, objects).
2. Develop and test SQL database connection.
3. Build **CRUD endpoints** and connect them to the database.

---

## Sprint 2: Spring Boot + NoSQL + Queries
### Goal:
- Develop your understanding of **NoSQL** databases, and advance Spring Boot integration with queries.

### Code:
- Extend CRUD app to include a **NoSQL database** like MongoDB.
- Write complex queries for filtering and sorting.

### Book:
- *Head First Design Patterns* - Focus on key patterns: Factory, Singleton, Strategy.

### Major Deliverable:
- Backend application with **SQL and NoSQL** compatibility, supporting advanced queries.

### Milestones:
1. Setup MongoDB and integrate it with Spring Boot.
2. Refactor app to allow switching between SQL and NoSQL.
3. Implement and test query endpoints.

---

## Sprint 3: APIs (REST + GraphQL) + Queries
### Goal:
- Create a robust backend with REST APIs and **GraphQL endpoints**.

### Code:
- Develop **RESTful APIs** following best practices.
- Add **GraphQL endpoints** to allow flexible querying.

### Major Deliverable:
- REST API with full GraphQL support.

### Milestones:
1. Develop a REST API for CRUD operations.
2. Add GraphQL endpoints to query and mutate data.
3. Deploy the API locally and test with Postman/Insomnia.

---

## Sprint 4: WebSockets + Microservices
### Goal:
- Implement **WebSockets** for real-time communication and introduce **microservices** architecture.

### Code:
- Create a **microservices project** with at least two services.
- Add real-time updates using WebSockets (e.g., chat or notifications).

### Major Deliverable:
- A microservices project with a real-time feature.

### Milestones:
1. Build two independent microservices.
2. Add WebSocket support for real-time communication.
3. Test inter-service communication.

---

## Sprint 5: Redis + Caching + Kafka
### Goal:
- Enhance your microservices app with **caching** (Redis) and message processing (Kafka).

### Code:
- Integrate **Redis** to cache frequently accessed data.
- Add **Kafka** to manage asynchronous messaging between services.

### Book:
- *Clean Architecture* - Focus on organizing project structures.

### Major Deliverable:
- Microservices-based app with caching and Kafka messaging.

### Milestones:
1. Set up and test Redis caching layer.
2. Implement Kafka producer and consumer services.
3. Publish the clean microservices project to GitHub.

---

## Vacation Learning Plan
### Book:
- *System Design Interview* by Alex Xu (*2nd edition*).

### Code:
- MOOC Java tasks.
- Refactor and improve your **RestaurantManager** project.
