# MF01-UF01-PRA01: 10-Week Backend Development SCRUM Sprint Planning

## Introduction

This document outlines a **10-week plan** for upcoming *SCRUM sprints* focused on backend development. It covers key areas including UML, JPA queries, various databases, system design, and deployment across different servers.

### Key Focus Areas:

1. UML (Unified Modeling Language)
2. JPA (Java Persistence API) Queries
3. Databases (Postgres, Redis, MongoDB, DynamoDB)
4. System Design
5. Deployment (AWS & other servers)

## Code Blocks

Here's an example of how to write a Java code block:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
